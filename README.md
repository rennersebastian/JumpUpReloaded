=======================

Introduction
------------

JumpUp.me is the car-pooling community of the future. 
We want to change the mobility towards a request-when-you-need-it-model. Both drivers and passengers shall need less time in offering and finding rides.
If a passenger needs a ride from a place to another, JumpUp.me will find the best routes for him. 
If you are the driver, you just tell the system from which place you will drive to another. The system automatically calculates the correct prices, contains a meeting-point-finding system and finds trips that are near several routes of drivers and may contain via-waypoints.


Student project
------------

The idea of this project is to create a completely new backend for a better car pooling experience. Currently, an application prototype written in PHP Zend Framework 2 exists.
We will adapt this backend, but build a new and improved architecture based n J2EE technologies.
